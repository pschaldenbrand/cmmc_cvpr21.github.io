[__The Ear__](http://www.estebanagosin.cl/eng/the_ear.html) by [Esteban Y Agosin](http://www.estebanagosin.cl/eng/)

The ear is a listening, surveillance, and Artificial Intelligence project. It is a device that collects human voices, 
transcribe them into text, and with that information create new texts. The ear is a machine that through an Artificial
Intelligence system creates ideas in real time based on what it is listening to. This piece could be defined as an 
ironic idea of the surveillance system. In a way, it is not a perfect and functional machine, it constantly makes 
mistakes, degrading the original information from the source, creating erroneous and potentially false information,
digital garbage that in a way undermines the expected fantasies of technology and surveillance systems. The experience
with the piece show how the human voice is transformed into a digital object and that could be analyzed, recorded, 
transformed, stored, and used, questioning the concept, sense and value of the information, privacy and freedom in
our contemporary society, also questioning the relevance of the information collected in surveillance systems, and
the ethical and political limits in this type of devices.

[__Models for Environmental Literacy__](https://www.tivonrice.com/models.html) by [Tivon Rice](https://www.tivonrice.com)

Models for Environmental Literacy creatively and critically explores the challenges of describing a landscape, an 
ecosystem, or the specter of environmental collapse through human language. The project further explores how language
and vision are impacted by the mediating agency of new technologies. How do we see, feel, imagine, and talk about the
environment in this post-digital era, when there are indeed non-human/machine agents similarly trained to perceive
“natural” spaces? This project explores these questions, as well as emerging relationships with drone/computer vision
and A.I.

[__Permanent Visibility__](https://youtu.be/bazCs9Kyyt4) by [Nica Ross](https://nicaross.com/)

A virtual reality based essay that celebrates the failure of surveillance and nonhuman vision when applied to the human
form. The work is the result of capturing gender non-conforming bodies practicing Brazilian Jiu Jitsu in Carnegie 
Mellon's Panoptic Dome - a sensor-free motion capture studio. As the name implies the technology's intention is to 
fully capture and render the "truth" of a body's performance. Throughout the piece Jeremy Bentham's musings on the
perfection of the Panopticon's form are juxtaposed against the Dome's raw data. We see the noisy shadows of bodies
moving across the Dome's walls, digital skeletons popping in and out of sight as their movements shift outside of a
machine's understanding and we are left with the impression of their contact recorded in millions of point clouds. 
Bentham's words describe an omnipotent yet focused power harnessed by surveillance while queer bodies jump in and 
out of understanding in pursuit of joy rather than legibility.
