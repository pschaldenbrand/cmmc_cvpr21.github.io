# Questions

Panel 1: TBD Arts
- What are your methods and metrics for evaluating the creative AI system that you and your colleagues have developed?
- How does the study of creative AI systems inform human creative practice?
- How do we attribute (who is responsible for) the creativity in collaborative creative systems? 
- Do you think there is a difference between creative AI and human creativity? What would be the difference? If not, why not.

Panel 2: TBD Engineering
- What are your methods and metrics for evaluating the creative AI system that you and your colleagues have developed? 
- Do human creative methods provide valuable models for computational creativity? How does human creativity influence computational creativity?
- How do we attribute (who is responsible for) the creativity in collaborative creative systems? 
- How would you define creativity in generative models? If these models are specifically trained to generate new content, does this mean that they are necessarily creative?

Additional Questions (All)
- Are all generative systems "creative"? or… Is there a meaningful distinction between generativity and creativity?
- How can we contribute to a better definition of "creativity" (which is still fuzzy) using measures that capture computational creativity?
- Evaluating a creative work can be considered subjective. Can we (and should we) account for this subjectivity in our artificially intelligent evaluation methods, or should we strive to make objective measures?

# Participants

This session is an actual working session: together we will collaboratively define metrics for Creative AI. 

__Workshop Participant__ [This is their website/artwork/publication title](website.com)

Participants will be updated as they are confirmed.

# Call for Participation

Participants in this workshop, as a group, will examine a number of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Art projects, and articulate metrics to evaluate dimensions of creativity in those works. Workshop participants are key contributors to this research in Measuring Creative AI, and we plan for every participant to be named on future Measurable Creative AI publications (website, papers, etc.) as contributors. This is a novel research project with no prior examples as far as we know, and this workshop will be the inaugural event for this effort as this exercise has only been conducted with students previously.

__How to participate__: If you are interested to participate, please fill out the following google form by Some Deadline, Spring 2021.

Form: [google form link](googleform.com)

We will send out an acceptance notification by Spring, 2021.

# Metrics

Here is our metrics worksheet: [google docs](newmetricssheet.com)

We will publish our results after the workshop.
